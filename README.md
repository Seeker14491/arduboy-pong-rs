# arduboy-pong-rs

A very basic port of Pong to the [Arduboy](https://arduboy.com/), making use of the [`arduboy-rs`](https://github.com/Seeker14491/arduboy-rs) library.

It compiles to a static library which must then be linked into the project provided in the [ArduboyRust](https://github.com/Seeker14491/ArduboyRust) repo.
